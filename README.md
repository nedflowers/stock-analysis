# Stock Analysis Outcomes

## Overview of Project

    Refactor the All Stocks Anaysis code to loop through a handful of green-energy stock data in order to collect data. Then, determine if refactoring made the VBA script run more efficiently.   

## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Outline of Script

    In order to achieve a more efficient script, first, I created an outline of what the refactored could should look like.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

    One challenging part about completing the analysis was finding the balance between reusing and refactoring past code. Additionally, there were instances when I began to overthink and added too many variables to my script, which broke my code. I eventually realized that concise code ran more quickly and efficiently.

## Comparison

    The first difference between the refactored and original code is the new code begins by initializing variables for starting price and ending price, whereas the original code did not assign a data type until halfway through.

- Based on Outcomes of Campaigns, I can conclude campaigns with goals of less than 1000 are most likely to succeed, and least likely to fail. 

- One limitation of this data set is sample size. If I had more information for additional years, I could run the same formulas, and, perhaps, in adding more variables, find more distinct patterns within Outcomes Based on Goals. Along the same lines, the data collection took place from 2009-2017. Considering it has been almost five years since the end of 2017, the dataset may not be the most accurate representation of data, as it has aged. Additionally, I know the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people invest and donate money. It would be interesting to know how donations for Theater campaigns have evolved. Are people donating more money to theater to keep the art alive? Perhaps, people are investing less in plays, as the pandemic makes hosting large indoor events difficult.

- I could create a line chart comparing campaign launch dates, by month, like we have, but include other categories besides theater. This could show if there is a bias in the Outcomes vs Launch Dates chart. Additionally, we could make a bar graph with total amount pledged per category. The chart would be helpful to determine a more precise dollar-amount for a successful Theater campaign.

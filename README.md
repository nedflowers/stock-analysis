# Stock Analysis Outcomes

## Overview of Project
- Refactor the All Stocks Anaysis code to loop through a handful of green-energy stock data in order to collect data. Then, determine if refactoring made the VBA script run more efficiently.   

## Analysis and Challenges
 
### Outline of Script
- In order to achieve a more efficient script, first, I created an outline of what the refactored could should look like.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One challenging part about completing the analysis was finding the balance between reusing and refactoring past code. Additionally, there were instances when I began to overthink and added too many variables to my script, which broke my code. I eventually realized that concise code ran more quickly and efficiently.

## Comparison

### Stock Year to Year Comparison
- The first thing I notice is the stark difference between the years. In 2017, most returns seem profitable with "DQ" earning a 199.99% return rate. That same year, "TERP" was the only stock to go red at -7.2% return.
